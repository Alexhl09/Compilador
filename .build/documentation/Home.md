  - [Queue](/Queue)
  - [Stack](/Stack)
  - [ArrayLinkedList](/ArrayLinkedList):
    The arrays has a linked list with node representing the information of each dimension.
  - [ArrayLinkedList.Index](/ArrayLinkedList_Index)
  - [SymbolTable](/SymbolTable):
    Symbol Table is a linked list of node, each node representing one scope.
    Each node has a dictionary that keeps track of each symbol saved
  - [SymbolTable.Index](/SymbolTable_Index)
