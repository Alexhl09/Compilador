# Decodable

``` swift
public protocol Decodable 
```

## Default Implementations

### `decode(_:)`

``` swift
static func decode(_ json: JSON) -> Decoded<Self> 
```

### `decode(_:)`

``` swift
static func decode(_ json: JSON) -> Decoded<Self> 
```

## Requirements

### DecodedType

The type of object that will be decoded.

``` swift
associatedtype DecodedType = Self
```

In order to work with the rest of Argo, this needs to be the same as `Self`.

You will only need to worry about this if the object conforming to
`Decodable` is a reference type (i.e. a `class`), and one of the following
is true:

  - Your type is not marked as `final`

  - Your `decode` function is not marked as either `final` or `static`

In that case, you will need to explicitly set `DecodedType` to the type you
are returning in order for the compiler to be able to guarantee that this
protocol is being fully conformed to.

We expect the need for this typealias to be removed in a later version of Swift.

### decode(\_:â€‹)

Decode an object from JSON.

``` swift
static func decode(_ json: JSON) -> Decoded<DecodedType>
```

This is the main entry point for Argo. This function declares how the
conforming type should be decoded from JSON. Since this is a failable
operation, we need to return a `Decoded` type from this function.

#### Parameters

  - json: The `JSON` representation of this object

#### Returns

A decoded instance of the `DecodedType`
