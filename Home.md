# Types

  - [ArrayNode](/ArrayNode.md):
    This class represents the nodes of the linked list generated to be used to keep track of the dimension of a multidimensional array
  - [Symbol](/Symbol.md):
    The symbol is one object that encapsulates the information of something that has been declared with an identifier.
    It could be a variable, constant, array, or a function. It constains all the information needed to execute some operations in the semantic analysis
  - [Node](/Node.md)
  - [Queue](/Queue.md)
  - [Stack](/Stack.md)
  - [ArrayLinkedList](/ArrayLinkedList.md):
    The arrays has a linked list with node representing the information of each dimension.
  - [ArrayLinkedList.Index](/ArrayLinkedList_Index.md)
  - [SymbolTable](/SymbolTable.md):
    Symbol Table is a linked list of node, each node representing one scope.
    Each node has a dictionary that keeps track of each symbol saved
  - [SymbolTable.Index](/SymbolTable_Index.md)
